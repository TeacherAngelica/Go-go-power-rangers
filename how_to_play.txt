            defense point (DEF)

        A unit can be chosen to be either one of the following character types:
        1. Troll â€“ A strong attack but careless monster that has 50% chance of missing its target
        2. Knight - A soldier with decent attack and strong defense
        3. Mage - A spell caster with low attack/defense
        Each character type has different strengths in ATK and DEF point. In addition, a Mage has special
        ability to cast spells that can impact friendly and enemy units (eg Heal, Poison, Cure, Freeze).
