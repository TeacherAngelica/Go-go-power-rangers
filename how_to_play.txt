How to Play
 
    Content:
    - Player to choose game mode either 1 player or 2 player mode
    - Player to setup a team of units for battle (default is 3). 
    - Each unit has a unique name and attributes:
            health point (HP)
            attack point (ATK)
            defence point (DEF)
            experience point (EXP)
            and a rank (default is level 1).

        A unit can be chosen to be either one of the following character types:
        1. Troll - A strong attack but careless monster that has 50% chance of missing its target
        2. Knight - A soldier with decent attack and strong defence
        3. Mage - A spell caster with low attack/defence
        Each character type has different strengths in ATK and DEF point. In addition, a Mage has special
        ability to cast spells that can impact friendly and enemy units (eg Heal, Poison, Cure, Freeze)
