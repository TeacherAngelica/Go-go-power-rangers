            defence point (DEF)
            experience point (EXP)
            and a rank (default is level 1).

        A unit can be chosen to be either one of the following character types:
        1. Troll – A strong attack but careless monster that has 50% chance of missing its target
        2. Knight - A soldier with decent attack and strong defence
        3. Mage - A spell caster with low attack/defence

#Gameplay must indicate the turn number during the battle (eg Turn #1 player
1’s action, Turn #10 player 2’s action). When all units are non-active (eg
frozen), player will lose a turn automatically.

A unit will be removed from the team list (or flagged as “dead”) when the HP
become 0 or less, and will not be available to be selected for action. This can
happen right after an attack or a poison effect.
